ArcBit
===========
Bitcoin web wallet for Chrome. Visit http://www.arcbit.io/ for more information.


ArcBit Web is a port of ArcBit iOS project found here https://github.com/arcbit/arcbit-ios
You may notice similarities of the UI to the DarkWallet project (https://github.com/darkwallet/darkwallet). This is because a lot of the frontend code was taken from there and used in ArcBit. However, from a functional standpoint, ArcBit is very different then DarkWallet. ArcBit uses Insight or blockchain.info (depending on what the user picked in settings) to fetch blockchain data and an ArcBit server to keep track of reusable address transactions. ArcBit also gives the user the 2 different options to manage their wallet security.
1. You can have the ArcBit Wallet always encrypted in the browsers local storage. This means that you will always require to enter your login/decryption password (by default it is the 12 word seed that is generated for you when you create a wallet) when you close the ArcBit wallet tab or Chrome.
2. Alternatively you can have your ArcBit Wallet encrypted only if you explicitly click logout. This means that if you just close the ArcBit Wallet browser tab or even if you exit Chrome without clicking logout, you can reopen ArcBit without having to login.
